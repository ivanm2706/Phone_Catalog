This commercial online store is a modern platform for online shopping, which includes a number of user-friendly features, namely:

- view the product gallery, where you can see photos and descriptions of each product.

- selection of the category of goods, which is located in the navigation menu on the site.

- implemented pagination, which allows users to easily navigate to the next page of products.

- added the ability to add favorite products to a separate list to easily find them later.

- Added a shopping cart that allows users to select and buy products.

Modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, SCSS and BEM were used in the implementation of this online store. For routing and navigation between pages, the React Router library was used. Thanks to the browser's local storage (localStorage), it was possible to save selected items in the shopping cart even if the user closed the browser.
